## Django Management Project

This Django project is a management system that includes authentication and teacher management features.

### URL Configuration

The URL configuration is located in the `urls.py` file. It includes routes for:

- Admin interface (`admin/`)
- Home page (`/`)
- User authentication (`login` and `logout`)
- Teacher management (`dashboard`, `dashboard/teacher/add`, `dashboard/teacher/view`, `dashboard/teacher/edit/<int:id>`, `dashboard/teacher/delete/<int:id>`, and `dashboard/teacher/filterview`)

### Views

The views are located in the `views.py` file. They include:

- `index`: Renders the home page.
- `login_user`: Authenticates a user and logs them in.
- `logout_user`: Logs out a user.
- `dashboard`: Renders the dashboard page.
- `teacher_add`: Adds a new teacher.
- `teacher_view`: Displays all teachers.
- `teacher_edit`: Edits a teacher's details.
- `teacher_delete`: Deletes a teacher.
- `teacher_filterview`: Filters the view of teachers.

### Authentication

The system uses Django's built-in authentication system. Users can log in and log out. The `login_user` view handles user authentication.

### Teacher Management

The system allows for the management of teachers. Teachers can be added, viewed, edited, and deleted. The `teacher_add`, `teacher_view`, `teacher_edit`, and `teacher_delete` views handle these operations, respectively.

### Email Notifications

The system sends email notifications when a teacher is added, their details are updated, or they are deleted. The `send_email` function is used for this purpose.

## Setup
